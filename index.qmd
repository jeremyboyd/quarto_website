I'm a Health Data Scientist in the Research Department at the Boise VA Medical Center. My training is in cognitive science and includes expertise in building statistical and machine learning models, and creating and managing databases. I've applied these skills over the course of my career in various capacities: (1) as a research scientist at several academic institutions studying language learning, (2) doing organizational science in industry, and (3) at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs working on biomedical studies.
